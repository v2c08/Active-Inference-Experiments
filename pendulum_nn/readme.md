# Inverted pendulum task with neural network recognition model

The objective here is to have the network output 
predicting velocity (v) at t+1 given x,y,v at t.

A nice simple experiment that i didn't have time to revisit.
Seems to work but needs verification.

Here the weight & bias parameters of the neural network are 'free' to be 
learned under ADEM.

Entry point is 'main.m'
