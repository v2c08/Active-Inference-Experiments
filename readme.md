# Active Inference Demos

Some scripts/experiments:

1. 1 level biped (continuous    - ADEM) - python/matlab
2. pendulum_nn   (continuous    - ADEM) - python/matlab
3. blackjack     (discrete hier - VB_X) - matlab
4. pong  	 (mixed hier    - VB  ) - python/matlab 


For all demos, spm trunk should be on your matlab path.

For any python/matlab tasks you must run 'gym_https_server.py' from a 
python shell before/while running the simulation.

An accompanying readme exists in each folder.
